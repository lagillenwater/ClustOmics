# ClustOmics

## Organizational shared working space (ie github repository)
    Specific workflow using GIT (maybe AGILE) - master branch-- development branch (testing)-- issue branch  
    Git lab has a board for in progress processes ranked by importance
    versioning for commits - updating based on changes
    

## Turning each of our component parts into individual functions that take as inputs the output data from the previous step.

      what other outputs would be helpful for each stage (ie summary statistics, visualizations)?
         
      Also, what sort of parameters are necessary for the tuning of these functions?
        
      How does the function scale to larger datasets?
        
       Caching outputs
        
## In addition, if we are aiming for bioconductor (which we should), what bioconductor functions can we link to? 
    Utilize data structures
    Only use packages on bioconductor or cran

## Adding a shiny GUI
  wrap functions in gui after creating the package - declare as reactive
  design session with everyone
  
## Functions - Friday
  Data Input/Management (Lucas?)
  Filtering (Lucas)  
  Dimension Reduction (Evan)
  Clustering (Shahab)

## Next Meeting - 9/4-9/6
